## Introduction
The Virtual Data Centre (VDC) lab provides a theoretical overview and hands on lab to take the learner through the key constructs that are recommended for larger enterprise customers deploying to Azure.     

## VDC Workshop Topics
* Deploy up the VDC lab 
* Explore the VDC environment
* Configure VDC routing with NVAs and UDRs
* Secure VDC with NSGs and Policies
* Monitor VDC with Network Watcher and Azure Monitor
* Role Based Access Control in a hub and spoke topology

## Pre-requisites
The workshop requires the following:
* **[Azure Subscription]({{ site.url }}/guides/subscription)**
  * If your workshop is being hosted by a Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) then you will be provided with a code for an **Azure Pass** subscription
    * Open a private browser session, go to http://signup.live.com and create a new  Microsoft account in  **vdc._firstname.lastname_@outlook.com** format 
    * Go to https://www.microsoftazurepass.com and follow the instructions to redeem the code and activate your Azure Pass
  * If you will be using you own subscription (e.g. Visual Studio Enterprise) then you can confirm that the subscription is valid for the workshop by checking the following in the portal: 
    * prove the ability to create resources by creating a new resource group
    * check there are no stringent Virtual Machine or CPU quotas in Subscriptions -> Usage + Quotas
    * within Azure Active Directory, create a test user and group
  * Common pitfalls to avoid:
    * Free Trial accounts may have a CPU quota that is insufficient for the lab environment deployment to successfully complete
    * Redeeming an Azure Pass code against an email address previously used for a trial will succeed, but the activation will fail
    * Using a work email may mean that you do not have write access to the company's directory and therefore you cannot create users and groups
* **Cloud Shell**
  * In the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com), click on the Cloud Shell icon at the top of the screen (**>_**), create the storage account for clouddrive and confirm it is working by typing ```az account show```
* [Bash and CLI 2.0]({{ site.url }}/guides/wsl) (optional, recommended, only applicable for Windows 10)
