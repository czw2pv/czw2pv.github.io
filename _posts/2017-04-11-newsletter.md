## The Azure Podcast
 

If you are anything like me, you’ll be struggling to find the time to stay up to date with the latest news in the technology world, I rely on many aggregation services, RSS feeds, Twitter and Podcasts. You may or may not be aware of The Azure Podcast run by Sujit D’Mello, Cale Teeter, Evan Basalik and our very own UK PDU CSA-P Russell Young. The podcast covers a wide variety of technologies and very often product owners and programme managers will be invited to speak about new technologies which are coming down the line. If you are not already subscribed, please check out the following link for details.

## Instant File Recovery from Azure Linux VMs 


If you are someone who “drinks and roots” then you may be thankful that Azure now supports, in preview, the ability to perform file level recovery restores on Linux VMs. This functionality is supported across Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Redhat and Oracle Linux (Please consult the following link for supported version levels).

## Azure Monitor Generally Available


Azure Monitor, generally available since the end of March is a great tool within the Resource Manager portal which enables easy access to metric data coming out of your resource types. Azure monitor gives you 30-days, for free, of retention data on resource type activity. You may have already been using Azure Monitor through the “Activity Log” of your various resource types, but now it is available as a stand alone blade to monitor all your ARM based resources.

## Azure gaining adoption in the Enterprise


A survey commissioned by Sumo Logic (www.sumologic.com) and run by UBM research has found that Azure is the preferred cloud platform of choice in the enterprise. This is not really surprising given the Microsoft heritage in the enterprise and our commitment to innovation. However the survey is significant as Azure has traditionally held the second place to AWS in terms of Cloud usage and adoption. Please see the following link for details on the survey
