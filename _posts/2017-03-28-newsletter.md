## The importance of Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)


Digital Partner of record is a tool used within an Azure subscription to identify the Microsoft partner who has a strategic role in assisting customers through their cloud transformation and ongoing consumption of Azure resources. 

As a partner, you are crucial to customer success in selling, implementing, deploying, or managing solutions based on Microsoft cloud services. We strive to ensure every customer has the level of partner support they need to maximize their business outcomes from these solutions. 

We recognize partners for the role(s) they play in supporting these cloud-based solutions, from the initial transaction to the solution deployment and ongoing customer support. Recently, we announced new program enhancements that will benefit all the partners involved in a cloud subscription, as well as the Digital Partner of Record (DPOR). 

In addition, the customer’s Global Admin for each cloud subscription can designate their lead services partner as the DPOR through their admin portal, which identifies the key services/lifecycle support partner who’s engaged in providing ongoing support. DPORs have access to important information necessary to fully support customers and will be the contact for FastTrack services.

For more details around the benefits of DPOR and what it means for you as a Microsoft partner, please review the link below. If you have any questions, please do reach out to us. Also please take a look the attached PDF file which highlights many of the incentives around DPOR and what it means to partners

## Build your Azure Cloud Practice
 

As a partner in the Microsoft Practice Development Unit, it’s our goal to ensure you have everything you need to transform your business into a flourishing public cloud orientated business. With this goal in mind, Microsoft have created a series of Playbooks, these Playbooks are focused on the “how” around creating successful Cloud Practices across what we see as the four main areas for Microsoft partners looking to deliver cloud services to their customers. 
 

**Cloud Infrastructure and Management**
**Data Platform & Analytics**
**Cloud Application Development**
**Enterprise Mobility & Security**
 

In the Practice Development Unit we advise all our partners to review these Playbooks as part of their cloud practice development transformation. You can find the links to these Playbooks via visiting the following page and filling out the required form to access the download links
