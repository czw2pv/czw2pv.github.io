Azure Container Service (ACS) allows you to quickly deploy a production ready Kubernetes, DC/OS, or Docker Swarm cluster.  AKS provides a fully managed Kubernetes based ACS cluster - it reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading much of that responsibility to the Azure platform.

In this lab we explore the use of AKS.
