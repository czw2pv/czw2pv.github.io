### Yepp
I made a simple poll on Twitter to help me get started with this web site.
The question I asked was:
When you look at learning or ramping up on a subject, what type of content do you prefer?
The response I got ws that: 
1. 43% prefers Video content
2. 25% prefers How to guides
3. 21% prefers Technical documentation
4. 11% prefers Classroom training

Since twitter polls are characther limted I could create more options. But I got some extra comments that commented PowerShell examples are useful.  
I will start off by that input but might change and ask you again in a future post or on twitter what kind of content you need.

Thanks
